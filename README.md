# Annotations Restored (embedded)

Userscript for bringing annotations back to embedded YouTube videos.

# Install

Once you have a userscript manager, [click here](https://github.com/PluieElectrique/annotations-restored-embed/raw/master/annotations-restored-embed.user.js) to install.

# Usage

The userscript is same as the original [Annotations Restored extension](https://github.com/isaackd/AnnotationsRestored), except that it only runs in embedded videos. Also, annotations are only fetched from invidio.us and links are opened in a new tab.

# Legal

This userscript is under the GPLv3 License. A copy can be found in the `LICENSE` file.

The original project (which this userscript is almost completely copied from) is [isaackd/AnnotationsRestored](https://github.com/isaackd/AnnotationsRestored). It is also licensed under the GPLv3.
